			<p>Let me start by introducing myself first. I am a student in lorma colleges and I'm 19 years old. I live in the philippines near above some mountains. I am both a cat and dog lover and I like having pets around. I like going out at 3AM in the morning together with my mug filled with freshly brewed coffee beans to enjoy the quite of emptiness and the cold breeze of fresh air the morning brings. Where the streets are quite and the only sounds we hear are the low hum of the wind and the odd cricket chirping. Where the roads which are normally filled with bustling traffics are completely empty, void of any cars.</p>

			<p>I am currently studying at the university of Lorma Colleges with a course of BS in Computer Science. I am now 2nd year at my course and to be honest I am already enjoying and having lots of fun learning and doing different kinds of things such as activities within my course.</p>

			<p>Personally, my top 5 hobbies are exercising, listening to educational podcasts, playing video games, coding some random stuffs and gardening for meditating purposes. I love exercising as it gives a lot of healthy benefits according to studies. And listening to podcasts at it gives me a lot of ideas and also trains my listening skills. But the most I spend my time of with is playing video games as this can improve my decision making, problem-solving and can also improve memory and learning.</p>

		<h1>SKILLS</h1>
		<p>I have some basic knowledge when it comes to programming and web designing. My very first programming language was python then after learning the basics I moved on to learning other programming languages as well such as java and c++. I also tried learning web development along with some of the popular web frameworks out there while I was learning on how to code. Below are the following programming languages and web desinging framworks I have been learning.</p>

			<p>Education means gaining different perspectives and understanding different people, experiences and histories. We need education, but we must not let our education rigidize into arrogance. Education should be the expansion of ideas, the deepening of empathy, and the broadening of horizons. It shouldn't make our biases more stubborn. If people are educated, they should become less certain, not more certain. They should listen more, talk less, be passionate about differences, and love what is different from what they think.</p>
